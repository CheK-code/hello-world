This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow

My passions are in drawing and animation along with the arts in general. I like to sketch in my freetime, write occasionally, read (books, comics, manga), and nerd out about animation. Outside of creative hobbies I enjoy listening to music, exercising, video games, and going on sidequests with my friends.
